# PlayerHeight Column Fix - Summary

## Problem
The original `train.csv` file had a corrupted PlayerHeight column that used month names to represent feet:
- `3-Jun` meant 6 feet 3 inches (June = 6th month = 6 feet)
- `Jun-00` meant 6 feet 0 inches  
- `11-May` meant 5 feet 11 inches (May = 5th month = 5 feet)

## Solution
1. **Created a conversion function** that properly interprets the month-based encoding
2. **Generated a fixed CSV file** with proper feet-inches format
3. **Updated the data_loader.py** to handle the standard feet-inches format
4. **Replaced the original file** with the corrected version

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `fix_playerheight_csv.py` - Script to fix the CSV file
- `train_original_backup.csv` - Backup of original corrupted file
- `train_fixed.csv` - Temporary fixed file (later copied to train.csv)

### Modified Files:
- `data_loader.py` - Updated height conversion function
- `train.csv` - Replaced with corrected data

## Results

### Before Fix:
```
PlayerHeight values (corrupted):
3-Jun     108240
4-Jun      90139  
5-Jun      83706
1-Jun      82336
2-Jun      71347
Jun-00     67819
```

### After Fix:
```
PlayerHeight values (corrected):
6-03    108240  (6 feet 3 inches)
6-04     90139  (6 feet 4 inches)
6-05     83706  (6 feet 5 inches)  
6-01     82336  (6 feet 1 inch)
6-02     71347  (6 feet 2 inches)
6-00     67819  (6 feet 0 inches)
```

## Height Distribution
- **Range**: 5'6" to 6'9" (66-81 inches)
- **Average**: 74.4 inches (6'2.4")
- **Most common**: 6'3" (75 inches)
- **Distribution**: Realistic bell curve for NFL players

## Benefits
1. **No more conversion needed** - Heights are now in standard format
2. **Prevents confusion** - Clear feet-inches notation (e.g., "6-03")
3. **Maintains data integrity** - All original height data preserved
4. **Future-proof** - Works with standard height parsing libraries
5. **Backup preserved** - Original file saved as `train_original_backup.csv`

## Usage
The `data_loader.py` now works seamlessly with the corrected data:

```python
from data_loader import load_and_clean_data

# Loads corrected train.csv with proper height format
df = load_and_clean_data()

# PlayerHeightInches column now contains accurate measurements
print(df['PlayerHeightInches'].describe())
```

## File Sizes
- Original file: 234.64 MB
- Fixed file: 240.46 MB (slight increase due to formatting)

The PlayerHeight column is now permanently fixed and will not require special handling in the future!
