# Git Configuration Summary

## ✅ Changes Made

### 🚫 Updated .gitignore
- **Added `data/`** - Entire data directory is now excluded from version control
- **Enhanced Python exclusions** - Added comprehensive __pycache__ and .pyc patterns  
- **Added IDE/System files** - Common editor and system file patterns
- **Added Jupyter exclusions** - For future notebook development

### 🗑️ Cleanup
- **Removed root `__pycache__/`** - No longer needed after moving scripts
- **Old compiled files removed** - data_loader.cpython-313.pyc deleted

## 📁 Current Git Status

### Tracked Files (Will be committed):
```
✅ README.md (new)
✅ docs/ (new folder)
✅ scripts/ (new folder)  
✅ .gitignore (updated)
```

### Ignored Files (Won't be tracked):
```
🚫 data/ (entire folder including train.csv)
🚫 __pycache__/ (Python cache files)
🚫 .DS_Store (macOS system files)
🚫 IDE files (.vscode, .idea, etc.)
```

## 🔒 Benefits

1. **Large Data Files Excluded**: 247MB train.csv won't bloat the repo
2. **Clean Repository**: No compiled Python files or system junk
3. **Team-Friendly**: Others can use their own data files
4. **Future-Proof**: Comprehensive patterns for various file types

## 🎯 Next Steps

To commit the organized structure:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Organize project structure with proper folders and .gitignore"
```

The data folder will remain local-only and won't be pushed to remote repositories.
